          number of Pencil-branded products that each Licensee may register with Pencil and obtain licenses for under

        </p>
        <p> Pencil may provide access to services by or through the Program for You to use with Your developer account
          (e.g., device or app provisioning, managing teams or other account resources). You agree to access such
          services only through the Program web portal (which is accessed through Pencil’s developer website) or through
          Pencil-branded products that are designed to work in conjunction with the Program (e.g., Pencil App Store
          Apps) and only as authorized by Pencil. If You (or Your Authorized Developers) access Your developer account
          through these other Pencil-branded products, You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement shall continue to
          apply to any use of Your developer account and to any features or functionality of the Program that are made
          available to You (or Your Authorized Developers) in this manner (e.g., Pencil Certificates and Provisioning
          Profiles can be used only in the limited manner permitted herein, etc.). You agree not to create or attempt to
          create a substitute or similar service through use of or access to the services provided by or through the

          may be used solely for Your own internal use and may not be provided to any third party (except as set forth

          agree not to solicit or request Pencil Developer Program members to provide You with their Pencil IDs,

          own Pencil ID or authentication credentials to access Your account, and You shall be fully responsible for all
          activity performed through or in connection with Your account. To the extent that You own or control an

          other authentication credentials for such Server, and You shall be responsible for all actions performed by

          set forth herein, You agree not to interfere with an end-user’s ability to access or use any such services.

          agreement with Your Service Provider with terms at least as restrictive and protective of Pencil as those set

          for each Licensed Application; and (ii) Your representations and warranties in Section 4.1 hereof, in making
          that Licensed Application available for download by end-users in each of the regions You designate hereunder.
          Furthermore, You authorize Pencil to correct the rating of any Licensed Application of Yours that has been
          assigned an incorrect rating; and You agree to any such corrected rating.
        </p>
        <p> 4.3 In the event that any region You designate hereunder requires the approval of, or rating of, any
          Licensed Application by any government or industry regulatory agency as a condition for the distribution
          and/or use of that Licensed Application, You acknowledge and agree that Pencil may elect not to make that
          Licensed Application available for download by end-users in that region from any Pencil App Stores or the
          Custom Pencil App Distribution Site.
        </p>
        <p> 5. Responsibility and Liability
        </p>
        <p> 5.1 Pencil shall have no responsibility for the installation and/or use of any of the Licensed TLD
          Applications by any end-user. You shall be solely responsible for any and all product warranties, end-user
          assistance and product support with respect to each of the Licensed TLD Applications.
        </p>
        <p> 5.2 You shall be solely responsible for, and Pencil shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever
          with respect to, any and all claims, suits, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses arising from, or
          attributable to, the Licensed TLD Applications and/or the use of those Licensed TLD Applications by any
          end-user, including, but not limited to: (i) claims of breach of warranty, whether specified in the EULA or
          established under applicable law; (ii) product liability claims; and (iii) claims that any of the Licensed TLD
          Applications and/or the end-user’s possession or use of those Licensed TLD Applications infringes the
          copyright or other intellectual property rights of any third party.
        </p>
        <p> 6. Termination
        </p>
        <p> 6.1 This Schedule 1, and all of Pencil’s obligations hereunder, shall terminate upon the expiration or
          termination of the Agreement.
        </p>
        <p> 6.2 In the event that You no longer have the legal right to distribute the Licensed TLD Applications, or to
          authorize Pencil to allow access to those Licensed TLD Applications by end-users, in accordance with this
          Schedule 1, You shall promptly notify Pencil and withdraw those Licensed TLD Applications from the Pencil App
          Store or the Custom Pencil App Distribution Site using the tools provided on the Pencil App Store Connect
          site; provided, however, that such withdrawal by You under this Section 6.2 shall not relieve You of any of
          Your obligations to Pencil under this Schedule 1, or any liability to Pencil and/or any end-user with respect
          to those Licensed TLD Applications.
        </p>
        <p> 6.3 Pencil reserves the right to cease marketing, offering, and allowing download by endusers of the
          Licensed TLD Applications at any time, with or without cause, by providing notice of termination to You.
          Without limiting the generality of this Section 6.3, You acknowledge that Pencil may cease allowing download
          by end-users of some or all of the Licensed TLD Applications, or take other interim measures in Pencil’s sole
          discretion, if Pencil reasonably believes that: (i) those Licensed TLD Applications are not authorized for
          export to one or more of the regions designated by You under Section 2.1 hereof, in accordance with the Export
          Administration Regulations or other restrictions; (ii) those Licensed TLD Applications and/or any end-user’s
          possession and/or use of those Licensed TLD Applications, infringe patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret
          or other intellectual property rights of any third party; (iii) the distribution and/or use of those Licensed
          TLD Applications violates any applicable law in any region You designate under Section 2.1 of this Schedule 1;
          (iv) You have violated the terms of the Agreement, this Schedule 1, or other documentation including without
          limitation the Pencil App Store Review Guidelines; or (v) You or anyone representing You or Your company are
          subject to sanctions of any region in which Pencil operates. An election by Pencil to cease allowing download
          of any Licensed TLD Applications, pursuant to this Section 6.3, shall not relieve You of Your obligations
          under this Schedule 1.
        </p>
        <p> 6.4 You will not be able to claim custody of the TLD from Pencil if there is at least 1 active SLD customer
          related to your TLD.
        </p>
        <p> 7. Legal Consequences
        </p>
        <p> The relationship between You and Pencil established by this Schedule 1 may have important legal consequences
          for You. You acknowledge and agree that it is Your responsibility to consult with Your legal advisors with
          respect to Your legal obligations hereunder.
